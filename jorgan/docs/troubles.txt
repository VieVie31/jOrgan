jOrgan Troubleshooting Guide

* What should I do with downloaded zip files?
A zip file is a compressed collection of other files. You have to use a zip program like WinZip to extract these files to an arbitrary location of your computer. On Windows the directory 'c:\Program Files\jOrgan' should be appropriate, further answers will refer to this directory with <jOrgan-installation-directory>.

* WinZip complains that jOrgan-xy.zip is corrupted.
In jOrgan-xy.zip you'll find all files (see A3) that are needed to run jOrgan. Please download the zip file once again.

* When I double-click the file jOrgan.jar, I am asked what to do with that file.
jOrgan runs on Windows, Linux and Os X. To be able to support all these operation systems jOrgan is based on a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Please make sure that you have a JRE installed on your computer, this will enable you to use many other programs written in Java (see http://www.java.com).

* I double-click the file jOrgan.jar but nothing happens.
Verify that a 1.5 compatible (or newer) JRE is installed. Open a command shell and enter 'java -version' to see your current Java version (output should look similar):
    java version "1.5.0"
    Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0-b64)
    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0-b64, mixed mode)

* My Java version is sufficient but still nothing happens.
Please ensure that you've extracted (see A1) all files contained in jOrgan-xy.zip to the correct location:
    /<jOrgan-installation-directory>
       jOrgan.jar
       /lib
          core.jar
          swingx.jar
          spin.jar
       /docs
          gpl.txt
          authors.txt
          troubles.txt
